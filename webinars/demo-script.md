Emailed from CEO
Please see exported tickets from Zendesk activity in 2024 I got IT to do for us
Have looked it over and thinking our priorities for 2025 should be:

1. Respond quickly
2. Provide a great experience
3. Support the sales team with identifying opportunities to engage

Please can you look into the data more to help with presenting to the entire customer support team.

Thank you.
