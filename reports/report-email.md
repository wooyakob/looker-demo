Hi Jacob,

I have investigated 2024 Zendesk activity and found the following insights for our team to look into further, so we're able to deliver successfully in 2025.

The most issues reported by our customers came from:

1. Omega Systems (9)
2. Epsilon Corp (8)

I'd recommend we look to prioritize these customers at the start of Q1 2025, either pulling in a dedicated resource to resolve issues faster, or offering a discount/access to a new feature for free.

My team struggles the most with responding to issues at the start of the year. It'd be great to get an extra part time resource to support us during our busy period.

We also experience a lot of login issues at the start of the year, please can we check our password reset, 2FA requirements and can updates be spread over the year, rather than frontloaded in January.

The hardest issues that take the longest for us to resolve are generally API related. Please can our technical, product and integration teams review the API documentation, quickstarts, to help our customers get up to speed easier.

Around 20% of our tickets are getting the highest rating for satisfaction scores. Liam Johnson, Sophia Green, are both on Database Free Trials and enjoying our support experience. These are perhaps good candidates for our sales team to follow up with for an upgrade.

From our product portfolio, Visionary received the most support requests. I can let our product team know, as it would be good to work together to investigate why this specific product is causing our customers a lot of challenges.

Have attached the report for your review, look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Thank you,
